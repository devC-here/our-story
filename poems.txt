In the quiet of the night, I think of you
Your smile, a beacon in the dark
Guiding me through shadows deep
To where your heart and mine both spark

Every moment spent with you
Is a treasure I hold dear
A memory etched in golden light
That keeps me ever near

Though distance may keep us apart
My love for you will never fade
For you are the song my heart sings
The masterpiece that time has made


Your laughter echoes in my mind
A melody so sweet and pure
It lifts my spirit high above
And makes my weary soul endure

When I close my eyes at night
I see your face so bright and clear
A vision of perfect beauty
That draws me ever near

In dreams we dance beneath the stars
Our hearts beating as one
Forever bound by love so true
Until our days are done


Like petals soft upon the breeze
Your touch brings me to life
Each whisper of your gentle voice
Cuts through my soul like a knife

Not in pain but in pure joy
That overwhelms my heart each day
For loving you has taught me how
To live in every way

You are my sun, my moon, my stars
My reason and my rhyme
The answer to my every prayer
My love for all of time


In gardens where the roses bloom
I see your beauty there
Each flower pales when next to you
None can truly compare

Your grace, your kindness, and your light
Illuminate my world
You are the banner of my love
Forever now unfurled

With you beside me I am whole
Without you I am lost
I'd give up everything I have
Pay any earthly cost


When morning breaks and sunlight streams
I wake and think of you
Of all the ways you've changed my life
And made my dreams come true

Your love has been my guiding star
Through storms and darkest night
You've shown me what it means to live
And filled my world with light

So here I stand before you now
With heart open and true
To tell you what you mean to me
I love you through and through
